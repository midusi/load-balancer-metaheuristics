/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/lifelines/utils/__init__.py:1122: ConvergenceWarning: Column group have very low variance when conditioned on death event present or not. This may harm convergence. This could be a form of 'complete separation'. For example, try the following code:

>>> events = df['E'].astype(bool)
>>> print(df.loc[events, 'group'].var())
>>> print(df.loc[~events, 'group'].var())

A very low variance means that the column group completely determines whether a subject dies or not. See https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/11109/how-to-deal-with-perfect-separation-in-logistic-regression.

/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/lifelines/utils/__init__.py:1122: ConvergenceWarning: Column group have very low variance when conditioned on death event present or not. This may harm convergence. This could be a form of 'complete separation'. For example, try the following code:

>>> events = df['E'].astype(bool)

/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/lifelines/utils/__init__.py:1122: ConvergenceWarning: Column group have very low variance when conditioned on death event present or not. This may harm convergence. This could be a form of 'complete separation'. For example, try the following code:

>>> events = df['E'].astype(bool)
>>> print(df.loc[events, 'group'].var())
>>> print(df.loc[~events, 'group'].var())

A very low variance means that the column group completely determines whether a subject dies or not. See https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/11109/how-to-deal-with-perfect-separation-in-logistic-regression.

/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/lifelines/utils/__init__.py:1122: ConvergenceWarning: Column group have very low variance when conditioned on death event present or not. This may harm convergence. This could be a form of 'complete separation'. For example, try the following code:

>>> events = df['E'].astype(bool)
>>> print(df.loc[events, 'group'].var())
>>> print(df.loc[~events, 'group'].var())

A very low variance means that the column group completely determines whether a subject dies or not. See https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/11109/how-to-deal-with-perfect-separation-in-logistic-regression.

/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/lifelines/utils/__init__.py:1122: ConvergenceWarning: Column group have very low variance when conditioned on death event present or not. This may harm convergence. This could be a form of 'complete separation'. For example, try the following code:

>>> events = df['E'].astype(bool)
>>> print(df.loc[events, 'group'].var())
>>> print(df.loc[~events, 'group'].var())

A very low variance means that the column group completely determines whether a subject dies or not. See https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/11109/how-to-deal-with-perfect-separation-in-logistic-regression.

This may imply non-unique solutions to the maximum likelihood. Perhaps there is collinearity or complete separation in the dataset?

/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/lifelines/utils/__init__.py:1122: ConvergenceWarning: Column group have very low variance when conditioned on death event present or not. This may harm convergence. This could be a form of 'complete separation'. For example, try the following code:

>>> events = df['E'].astype(bool)
>>> print(df.loc[events, 'group'].var())
>>> print(df.loc[~events, 'group'].var())

A very low variance means that the column group completely determines whether a subject dies or not. See https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/11109/how-to-deal-with-perfect-separation-in-logistic-regression.

/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/lifelines/utils/__init__.py:1122: ConvergenceWarning: Column group have very low variance when conditioned on death event present or not. This may harm convergence. This could be a form of 'complete separation'. For example, try the following code:

>>> events = df['E'].astype(bool)
>>> print(df.loc[events, 'group'].var())
>>> print(df.loc[~events, 'group'].var())

A very low variance means that the column group completely determines whether a subject dies or not. See https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/11109/how-to-deal-with-perfect-separation-in-logistic-regression.

This may imply non-unique solutions to the maximum likelihood. Perhaps there is collinearity or complete separation in the dataset?

/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/lifelines/utils/__init__.py:1122: ConvergenceWarning: Column group have very low variance when conditioned on death event present or not. This may harm convergence. This could be a form of 'complete separation'. For example, try the following code:

>>> events = df['E'].astype(bool)
>>> print(df.loc[events, 'group'].var())
>>> print(df.loc[~events, 'group'].var())

A very low variance means that the column group completely determines whether a subject dies or not. See https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/11109/how-to-deal-with-perfect-separation-in-logistic-regression.

/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/lifelines/utils/__init__.py:1122: ConvergenceWarning: Column group have very low variance when conditioned on death event present or not. This may harm convergence. This could be a form of 'complete separation'. For example, try the following code:

>>> events = df['E'].astype(bool)
>>> print(df.loc[events, 'group'].var())
>>> print(df.loc[~events, 'group'].var())

A very low variance means that the column group completely determines whether a subject dies or not. See https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/11109/how-to-deal-with-perfect-separation-in-logistic-regression.

This may imply non-unique solutions to the maximum likelihood. Perhaps there is collinearity or complete separation in the dataset?

/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/lifelines/utils/__init__.py:1122: ConvergenceWarning: Column group have very low variance when conditioned on death event present or not. This may harm convergence. This could be a form of 'complete separation'. For example, try the following code:

>>> events = df['E'].astype(bool)
>>> print(df.loc[events, 'group'].var())
>>> print(df.loc[~events, 'group'].var())

A very low variance means that the column group completely determines whether a subject dies or not. See https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/11109/how-to-deal-with-perfect-separation-in-logistic-regression.

/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/lifelines/utils/__init__.py:1122: ConvergenceWarning: Column group have very low variance when conditioned on death event present or not. This may harm convergence. This could be a form of 'complete separation'. For example, try the following code:

>>> events = df['E'].astype(bool)
>>> print(df.loc[events, 'group'].var())
>>> print(df.loc[~events, 'group'].var())

A very low variance means that the column group completely determines whether a subject dies or not. See https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/11109/how-to-deal-with-perfect-separation-in-logistic-regression.

/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/lifelines/utils/__init__.py:1122: ConvergenceWarning: Column group have very low variance when conditioned on death event present or not. This may harm convergence. This could be a form of 'complete separation'. For example, try the following code:

>>> events = df['E'].astype(bool)
>>> print(df.loc[events, 'group'].var())
>>> print(df.loc[~events, 'group'].var())

A very low variance means that the column group completely determines whether a subject dies or not. See https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/11109/how-to-deal-with-perfect-separation-in-logistic-regression.

This may imply non-unique solutions to the maximum likelihood. Perhaps there is collinearity or complete separation in the dataset?
